# ZeroWaste
A Food Waste Reduction Initiative


# Project Description

### **This Project was created during HackToFuture, 24 hour Hackathon organised by EG India held at SJEC, Mangalore**
### **Team: RUNTIME TERRORS ; Team Members: Aaron, Arathi, Prathvi**

## **Problem Statement:**  
Food waste and hunger are significant issues affecting many communities worldwide. A substantial amount of food is wasted by individuals, restaurants, supermarkets, and other organizations, while many people struggle to access healthy and nutritious food.

## **Solution:**  
A **food redistribution network** can be established to connect food donors with food recipients. This network can be operated by a team of volunteers who will:

- **Pick up** surplus food from donors.
- **Distribute** the collected food to food banks, shelters, community kitchens, and other organizations serving people in need.
- **Collaborate** with local farmers and growers to collect unsold produce and distribute it to food banks and community organizations.

## **Impact:**  
The food redistribution network aims to:

- **Reduce food waste.**
- **Increase access** to healthy and nutritious food.
- **Create a more sustainable food system.**

By redirecting surplus food to those in need, the network addresses food insecurity and poverty in local communities. Additionally, it raises awareness about food waste, encouraging individuals and organizations to take action to reduce their waste.

## **Implementation:**  
The food redistribution network can be implemented in collaboration with:

- **Local governments**
- **Food banks**
- **Community organizations**
- **Businesses**

**Promotion strategies** include:

- **Social media campaigns**
- **Community events**
- **Outreach efforts**

The network can also partner with local schools and universities to educate students about food waste and encourage them to volunteer. **Sustainability** can be achieved through:

- **Donations** from individuals and businesses
- **Grants** from foundations
